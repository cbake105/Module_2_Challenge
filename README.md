Using the Excel workbook in your .zip file, modify and analyze the sample-project data and try to uncover market trends.

- Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.

- Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live.

  - Create a new column called Percent Funded that uses a formula to find how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.

- Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 with a dark shade of red, and it should transition to green at 100 and blue at 200.

  - Create a new column called Average Donation that uses a formula to find how much each project backer paid on average.

  - Create two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, that use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two new, separate columns.

- Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes your initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category.

- Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category based on the table that you created.

- The dates in the deadline and launched_at columns use Unix timestamps. Fortunately for us, this formulaLinks to an external site. that can be used to convert these timestamps to a normal date.

  - Create a new column named Date Created Conversion that will use this formulaLinks to an external site. to convert the data contained in launched_at into Excel's date format.

  - Create a new column named Date Ended Conversion that will use this formulaLinks to an external site. to convert the data contained in deadline into Excel's date format.

  - Create a new sheet with a pivot table that has a column of outcome, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcome, and filters based on parent category and Years.

  - Now, create a pivot-chart line graph that visualizes this new table.

- Create a report in Microsoft Word, and answer the following questions:

  - Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

  - What are some limitations of this dataset?

  - What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
